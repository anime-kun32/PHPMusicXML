## Special Thanks

Thank you https://github.com/talobin/ for your library. We were inspirated to create PHP version from Kotlin version at https://github.com/talobin/MusicXML-Android/

We build the MusicXML model using annotation of each class.

Thank you https://github.com/robbie-cao/ for your library at https://github.com/robbie-cao/midi-class-php/. We learn much about MIDI file format and using code from your library and attach it to our code. We need MIDI parser before create MusicXML file from a MIDI file.
